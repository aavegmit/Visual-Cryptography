I have successfully implemented the concept of visual cryptography using bit manipulation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILES:

My homework 2 has a total of nine files, namely:
-main.cc
-decrypt.cc
-decrypt.h
-encrypt.cc
-encrypt.h
-stream.cc
-stream.h
-Makefile
-README

The decrypt.cc file has the functions to merge the shares and to decrypt the merged file into the original image.

The encrypt.cc file has the functions to encrypt the PBM file into two shares based on the concept of visual cryptography

The stream.cc file has the function to generate the simple stream cipher based on the passphrase.

The main function has the command line parsing function, which calls the respective function based on the command line option.

To make the execuatble the graders need to run " make " to create the executable.

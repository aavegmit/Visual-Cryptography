I have successfully implemented the base-64 encoding and decoding. Also, I produce the hexdump of the input obtained from STDIN or from a FILE. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILES:

My Warmup Project 1 has a total of nine files, namely:
-main.cc
-dec-base64.cc
-dec-base64.h
-enc-base64.cc
-enc-base64.h
-hexdump.cc
-hexdump.h
-Makefile
-README

The dec-base64.cc file has the functions to decode the encoded data back into its original form.

The enc-base64.cc file has the functions to encode the input data in to base-64 encoded form.

The hexdump.cc file has the function to produce the hexdump of the input data.

The main function has the command line parsing function, which calls the respective function based on the command line option.

To make the execuatble the graders need to run " make " to create the executable.

KNOWN BUGS:

1) In case of input from the STDIN, please press ctrl+D twice to terminate the input
